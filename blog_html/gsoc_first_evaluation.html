          	In the community bonding period I went over the code, read documentation, updated my timeline. I also did some reviewing of other's ticket and tried to fix some easy bugs. I reviewed the following tickets:

					<h4 id="doyle_krumm">Doyle - Krumm Algorithm: 4</h4>
          
          <p>
          	Now lets start with the main project, First part of my project was to implement
          	<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6501" target="_blank"><i>Doyle-Krumm Algorithm-4.</i></a> This algorithm
          	provides an efficient method to compute all elements of a number field (<b>K</b>) having
          	realtive height at most <b>B</b>. Initially in <b>sage</b> Algorithm-3 was implemented. 
          	So why implement algorithm-4?
          </p>
          


          <p>
          	A computer has a limited memory, hence there is a limit of storing data. Issues are due to the fact that in a computer we cannot work exactly with the real numbers that appear in the algorithm (heights of algebraic numbers, logarithms of real numbers, absolute values of algebraic numbers), so we must make do with rational approximations of them. Consider the 
          	following example:
          </p>

          	<pre>
          		<code>
sage: from sage.rings.number_field.bdd_height import bdd_height
sage: K.&lt;v&gt; = NumberField(x^3 + x + 1)
sage: bound = 3
sage: list(bdd_height(K,bound))
sage: for x in T:
.... 	print x, e**(K(x).global_height()*K.degree())
0 1.00000000000000
-v^2 + v - 1 2.14789903570479
v^2 - v + 1 2.14789903570479
v^2 + 1 1.46557123187677
-v^2 - 1 1.46557123187677
-1 1.00000000000000
1 1.00000000000000
-v 1.46557123187677
v 1.46557123187677
-v^2 2.14789903570479
v^2 2.14789903570479</code></pre>

          <p>
          	If we change the bound to just 3.1 we get:
          </p>
          	
          	<pre>
          		<code>
sage: from sage.rings.number_field.bdd_height import bdd_height

          <p>
          	So with example above it is clear that we were missing points whose height
          	were exactly 3 (due to approximation of real numbers). <b>Algorithm-4</b> provides a convinent way of finding approximations that are good enough to gurantee correct results. So the first step of this algorithm is to find a rational number between 2 real numbers. Any ideas how to do it?
          </p>

          <p>
          	That's where we apply elementry mathematics: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_property" target="_blank"> Archimedean's axiom</a>. Code belows shows the implementation:
          </p>

          <pre>
          	<code>
def rational_in(x,y):
    r"""
    Computes a rational number q, such that x&lt;q&lt;y using Archimedes' axiom
    """
    z = y - x
    n = RR(1/z).ceil() + 1
    if RR(n*y).ceil() is n*y:
        m = n*y - 1
    else:
        m = RR(n*y).floor()
    return m/n</code></pre>

					<p>
						There are many interesting concepts used in the implementation, but I can't discuss them here (don't want this to become boring). For more details you can see complete implementation <a href="https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/nwtzHqG696/" target="_blank">here</a>. Trac ticket containing my commits is:

				<h4 id="sieve_algorithm">Sieve Algorithm</h4>

					<p>
						Second part of my GSoC project is to replace search enumeration for subschemes, with much faster <b>Sieve Algorithm</b>. Basic idea behind the algorithms is to search points modulo prime and use chinese remainder theorem to reconstruct the rational points.
					</p>

					<p>
						Suppose <b>Y</b> is a subscheme defined as follows:
					</p>
<pre><code>
P.<x,y,z,q>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,3)
Y=P.subscheme([x^2-3^2*y^2+z*q,x+z+4*q])
bound = 10</code></pre>

					<p>
						Then to find rational points on <b>Y</b> we first find point modulo primes (2, 3, 7, 11), can be done using existing rational point finding function. Then we lift all possible combination of these point modulo prime and check that they belong to given subscheme (<b>Y</b>). Now how is this fast?
					</p>

					<p>
						Naturally this algorithm uses the existing <code>rational_points()</code>, but this time the search space is significantly reduced, as now the ring is finite. Second major improvement of this algorithm, is that computation of points modulo prime is done in parallel.
						hence the complexity is:
					</p>
<pre>
T(n) = max(T(p<sub>i</sub>)) for i &#8714; (1,k)  (since computation related to each prime is done in parallel)</pre>
        
        <p>
        	Other thing that can be done, is that computation related to each several combinations can be distributed evenly over other threads. Currently I have added parallel implementation of finding points modulo prime, and now working on parallelizing checking combinations. For the above example, some facts are:
        </p>
