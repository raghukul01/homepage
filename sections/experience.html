              <p>You can see my project summary <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6115725102546944" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/> This project aims at implementing basic algorithms for finding rational points on varieties. 
                Classically algebraic variety is defined as the set of solutions of polynomial equations over a number field. 
                A rational point of an algebraic variety is a solution of set of equations in the given field (rational field if not mentioned).
                 Much of the number theory can be viewed as the study of rational point of algebraic varieties. Some of the great achievements 
                 of number theory amount to determining the rational points on particular curves. For example, Fermat’s last theorem is equivalent
                to the statement that for an integer n ≥ 3, the only rational point of the curve xn+yn=zn in P2 over Qare the obvious ones. Common 
                variants of these question include determining the set of all points of V(K) of height up to some bound. The aim of this project is
                 to implement some basic rational point finding algorithms (sieving modulo prime and enumeration) and extend these to
                  product_projective_space scheme.</p>

              <p>Used AngularJS, Covalent   (TeraData)   and   other   frontend   Technologies   to   introduce   and  
                integrate   new   features   in   the   existing   website.   Learned   about   elastic   search,   and  
                reintroduced the search component in the website. </p>

              <p>Used   ​ MSER   for   text   detection,   wrote   code   for   MSER   using   OpenCV.   Also   wrote   a   script   to
